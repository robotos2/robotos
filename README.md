# RobotOS
## Getting started

### Introduction
RobotOS is a free operating system based on Debian, optimised for the Single Board Computer (SBC).

RobotOS is under active development, with an emphasis on adding more robot models support with the stability and performance of as many Debian packages as possible on a small hardware.

### Setting up your Robot OS

To get started with your Robot OS, you’ll need the following accessories:

* A computer monitor or television. Most should work as a display for the SBC hardware, but for best results, you should use a display with HDMI input. You’ll also need an appropriate display cable to connect your monitor to your SBC hardware.
* A computer keyboard and mouse
* Any standard USB keyboard and mouse will work with your SBC hardware.
* A good quality power supply.
* Finally, you’ll need an SD card; we recommend a minimum of 8GB micro SD card.

#### Connecting a Display
Unless you’re setting up your RobotOS to operate headless, for regular use, you’ll want to plug you SBC into a HDMI display.

#### SD Cards for Robot OS
This depends on you SBC some older model like on Raspberry Pi it uses full-size SD Card
##### Recommended Capacity
We recommend using an SD card of 8GB or greater capacity. If you are using the lite headless version of Robot OS, you can use a 4GB card.

### Installing the Operating System
Robot OS recommend the use of any Imager to install an operating system on to your SD card. You will need another computer with an SD card reader to install the image.
